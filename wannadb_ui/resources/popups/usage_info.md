# Usage

### 1. Create or load a document base
Put all .txt files from which the table is to be created later into a new directory and start the *Create Document Base* dialog.  
Apart from providing the path of the .txt files, the attribute names - columns of the resulting table - need to be specified to create a new document base.  
Alternatively you can load an already existing document base.

### 2. Check document base overview
After loading or creating a document base, the *Document Base Viewer* will be displayed concluding the current result of the table population.  
In the beginning, there won't be any resulting table as you need to populate the cells of each attribute in the interactive matching process first.

### 3. Populate cells
From the *Document Base Viewer* screen, you can start populating the cells for each attribute. 
Clicking the corresponding start button will invoke the interactive matching process for an attribute in which text snippets matching an attribute are determined.  
For more information check the *Underlying architecture and ideas* help section.

### 4. Export results
After matching all attributes, the resulting table can be exported in the menu via *Document Base* -> *Export table to CSV*.  
Furthermore, the resulting table can be saved for later use and modification via *Document base* -> *Save document base*.
