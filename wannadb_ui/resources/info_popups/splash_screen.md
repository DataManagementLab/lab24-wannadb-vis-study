WannaDB helps you to turn large collections of text into a concise table:

1) Load the text files you want to turn into a table. The system will then automatically prepare them.

2) Specify which columns your table should have. Then start the automatic table filling process.

3) You are requested to give some feedback/examples for possible entries for the first column. The system will learn from them to automatically find similar entries. By giving more feedback, you can improve the quality. Once the preview you see seems of sufficient quality, you can continue this process for the next column.

4) The system will use all the information gathered to fill the final table, without you having to read the other documents. Each row will represent one input document.
